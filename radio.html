            <p>your browser doesn't support the audio player, so you have to click listen live</p>

        <h3>what is this?</h3>
        <p>a small idea i had where members of hack club could suggest songs to be played in one radio station</p>
        <h3>how do i get one of my favorite songs on here?</h3>
        <p>dm ionixv on slack with the name and link to your song</p>
        <h3>how does it work?</h3>
        <p>i have a homelab running <a href="https://www.azuracast.com/">azuracast</a>, a open source radio station manager</p>
        <p>i take your request and put it in the main playlist, very simple indeed. the playlist loops until something stops it</p>
        <p>the radio station will run as long as the homelab is, which is most of the time unless the cats unplug it</p>
        <p>if the radio station is down, <b>dm me!!!!</b></p>
